## 🌟 Research & Project Experiences

### 🔹 [Integrated evaluation and optimization tools to improve accuracy of generative video ai](https://20201561kimgyeonghyeon.github.io/engineeringfestival/)
**Description:** Established a pipeline that utilizes CLIP and YOLO to evaluate the semantic and object-level similarity between text prompts and generated videos, followed by prompt tuning performed by an LLM based on the analysis outcomes.  
**Period:** Mar. 2025 ~ Present  
**Role:** Team Leader & Pipeline Implementation 
- Capstone design project for graduation work
- Compare the similarity between input prompts and output images of the generative video AI model
- Extract frames from video using OpenCV, Analyzed object presence and semantic similarity using YOLO and CLIP score
- A Large Language Model (LLM) was used to analyze the evaluation results and generate optimized prompt suggestions

### 🔹 [The structure of the large language model(LLM) application process for designing the reward function in reinforcement learning for autonomous ships](https://20201561kimgyeonghyeon.github.io/engineeringfestival/)
**Description:** Inspired by the EUREKA paper, this process utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate initial reward functions, which are then iteratively improved through human-in-the-loop feedback.  
**Period:** Feb. 2025 ~ Present  
**Role:** Undergraduate Researcher
- Research project at Dong-eui university
- As in ship reinforcement learning, reward function design becomes increasingly difficult as the environment grows more complex
- Created reward functions by guiding an LLM with RL environment code and task descriptions.
- Enabled non-experts to generate reward functions through LLM-guided automation, and reduced reward design time and trial-and-error
  
### 🔹 [Braille and Hangul Simultaneous Learning Devices for the Blind](https://gyeong-hyeonkim.github.io/externelactivity/engineeringfestival/)
**Description:** This device supports Braille education for the visually impaired by matching Hangul characters with corresponding Braille patterns, aiming to enhance learning efficiency and address literacy challenges.  
**Period:** Aug. 2024 ~ Nov. 2024  
**Role:** Team Leader & Hardware Design and Implementation
- Team Project for 2024 Creative Comprehensive Design Competition
- Represented Hangul and Braille using solenoid actuators
- Selected characters via a web interface, transmitted signals from Raspberry Pi to Arduino, and controlled solenoid actuators for tactile output
- Resolved power supply issues using an SMPS (Switched-Mode Power Supply)

### 🔹 [Medical Posture Correction Game for Disc Prevention and Patients](https://gyeong-hyeonkim.github.io/project/ICCAS_Project/)
**Description:** This AI-powered stretching game aims to prevent and rehabilitate spinal disc conditions by analyzing user posture in real time and integrating the results into interactive gameplay.  
**Period:** Apr. 2024 ~ Aug. 2024  
**Role:** Team Leader & AI Application Developer
- Team Project for Europe-Korea Conference on Science and Technology 2024
- Selected ResNet among PoseNet to extract human poses with improved accuracy
- Measured stretching accuracy using joint keypoints analyzed by rule-based AI
- Game damage varied based on stretching accuracy.
